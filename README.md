Several key factors influence how much kratom an individual should take:

**Body Weight and Metabolism**
- Larger individuals typically require higher doses
- Faster metabolism may reduce duration and intensity
- Age can affect processing speed and sensitivity

**Tolerance Levels**
- Regular users develop tolerance over time
- Previous opioid use may affect initial sensitivity
- Frequency of use directly impacts tolerance development

**Strain Potency**
- Different kratom strains contain varying alkaloid concentrations
- Red strains often require different dosing than white or green varieties
- Source and quality significantly impact potency

**Individual Sensitivity**
- Some people are naturally more sensitive to kratom's effects
